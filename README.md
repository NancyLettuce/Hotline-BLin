Description:
We want to create an RPG in which the player can assume the role of multiple characters in 
order to help the main character, BLin, achieve his goal of finding his true love, Rubik’s Cube. 
The player can choose BLin's talent:Math, CS, or Art Appreciation.

Other playable characters also have a specific skill, which is predetermined. A wrong choice can be fatal to 
BLin’s love life and leave him dateless for Prom. BLin has to complete multiple quests, such as 
assembling a team among those available, battling opponents and answering questions correctly.

Will BLin be able to save his damsel in distress?
